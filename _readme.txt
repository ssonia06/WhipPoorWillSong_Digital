Title: Whip-poor-will’s Song: A BalladAuthor: Millard, H. (Harrison) Place of Publication: Boston, MassachusettsPublisher: Oliver Ditson & Co.Date of Publication: 1865Colenda Entry: https://colenda.library.upenn.edu/catalog/81431-p37s7jc66Extract and Clean Text: I immediately noticed that any writing included in the cover image on the title page did not get transcribed; only the text at the bottom was captured. Similarly, the catalogue on the first page only transcribed the larger text at the top and bottom, while the smaller, thicker writing in the middle was left out. The catalogue on the last page was transcribed fully but with many errors to the point that I basically manually typed out the entire catalogue. When doing this, the column-like structure of the catalogue was lost. For the piece of music itself, the presence of lyrics underneath the musical notes caused many transcription errors — the OCR often confused the text placement and produced inaccurate results. I had to correct these issues manually by typing the lyrics directly from what I saw on the page. Overall, the OCR accuracy was relatively low for this type of source because of the mix of musical notation, varying font sizes, and decorative text. I ended up doing more manual correction than automatic cleanup since much of the text either failed to appear or was garbled. I didn’t encounter major technical errors while correcting, but it was time-consuming to separate the lyrics from the musical symbols. As for other media, like the staff lines and decorative illustrations, I was not able to accurately transcribe these into a text file. This feature is one of the larger features left out when converting the document.Organizing Photos and Generating Metadata: My goal was to provide metadata that allows each row to be understood independently—so that even if a row were separated from the larger dataset, a viewer could still recognize its role and placement within the overall document. In addition to including overarching details such as the file name, author, and publication information, I recorded the genre and resource type for each page, even though they are the same throughout, to help the viewer understand the physical nature of the material being viewed. When literature is digitized, its tangible qualities are often lost, but this metadata helps convey some sense of its material form. For the same reason, I included fields for physical description and subject. The physical collection and geographical subject information are intended to orient the viewer—clarifying both where the piece originated and where it is currently housed. Finally, I added a notes column to differentiate the roles of each page. This piece includes a title page, a catalog of popular songs, three pages of the ballad itself, and a closing catalog. The notes column helps the viewer identify and categorize each page’s function within the work.
