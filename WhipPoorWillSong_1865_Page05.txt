meet me When you hear the first whip-poor-will's song.....
2. 'Tis said that whatever sweet feelings
May be throbbing within a fond heart,
When list'ning to whip-poor-will's singing,
For a twelve-month will never depart;
So then we will meet in the woodland,
Far away from the hurrying throng,
And whisper our love to each other,
When we hear the first whip-poor-will's song.
Whip-poor-will, &c.
3. And in the long years of the future,
Though our duties may part us awhile,
And on the return of this evening,
We be severed by many a mile;
Yet deep in our bosoms we'll cherish
The affection so feryent and strong,
We pledged to each other tbis evening,
When we heard the first whip-poor-will's song.
Whip-poor-will, &c.
